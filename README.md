# Decentralized Escrow

Escrows require trusted third parties, this dapp is a proof of concept that shows how trustless escrow can powered by smart contracts, Chainlink Keepers, and Data Feeds. 

## Inspiration

When you spend an embarrassing amount of time on Twitter, you sometimes see ridiculous things. One of those things was a $2M bet on whether the spot price of $LUNA would be higher or lower than $88 in one year. The bet was for $1M between an anon trader: AIgod and the creator of Terra: Do Kwon. The trusted escrow for the bet is wealthy niche celebrity Cobie.

After reading the saga, it left me thinking two things:

1. Damn. I know I'm blessed, but now I feel extremely improvrished.
2. This could've been done in a trustless manner with smart contracts and Chainlink.
